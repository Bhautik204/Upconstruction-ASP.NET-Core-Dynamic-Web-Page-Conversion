This repository contains an ASP.NET Core MVC project that is a direct conversion of an existing dynamic HTML/CSS webpage. The goal of this project was to migrate the front-end design into the ASP.NET Core framework, leveraging the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern while preserving the original visual and interactive elements.

Key features include:
- Direct integration of existing HTML and CSS into Razor views.
- Structuring of the project within the ASP.NET Core MVC framework.
- Maintaining the original dynamic behavior using JavaScript/jQuery.
- No additional server-side functionality was added beyond the MVC structure.

This project can be used as a foundational template for developers looking to migrate or extend static or dynamic webpages into an ASP.NET Core MVC application.
