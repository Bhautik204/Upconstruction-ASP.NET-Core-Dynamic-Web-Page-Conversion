# ASP.NET Core MVC Conversion of HTML/CSS Dynamic Web Page

## Overview
This project represents a conversion of an existing HTML/CSS dynamic web page into an ASP.NET Core MVC application. The conversion focuses on retaining the original design, layout, and client-side functionality while organizing the project within the MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework provided by ASP.NET Core.

## Project Structure
- **Views:** The original HTML pages have been moved into the `Views` folder and are now rendered using Razor syntax within the ASP.NET Core MVC framework.
- **Controllers:** A simple controller has been added to handle the routing of requests to the appropriate views.
- **Static Files:** CSS, JavaScript, and image files are located in the `wwwroot` folder, following ASP.NET Core conventions.

## Features
- **Preserved Design:** The original look and feel of the website have been fully maintained.
- **Basic MVC Setup:** The project is structured following ASP.NET Core MVC principles but does not introduce additional server-side logic or database connectivity.
